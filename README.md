# BluntTournamentWeapons
In the vanilla game, tournament participants use edged weapons that cause blood splatters and stick to targets (if they're missiles).

This mod brings back tournaments with blunt weapons from Warband.

Credits to Terco_Viejo for modelling some of the blunt weapon parts and taking the videos and screenshots!

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
